Kaggle 
=========================

This is mostly a repository of not very well documented and
irreproducible results. In each of the subdirectories are the files
used to generate submissions for Kaggle competitions.

At first, the exercise on Kaggle is to get to a decent rank on the
leaderboard. Later I realized I needed to establish a well defined and
organized workflow to keep track of progress, reproduce and share
results.  This repo is towards that goal.

The place to start is the README in each of the directories, which
should provide some background on how the competition went and point
to the right ipynb file.
