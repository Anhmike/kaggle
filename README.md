Kaggle 
=========================

In each of the subdirectories is the colletion of loose files that
were used to generate the submissions for their respective Kaggle
competitions.

This is mostly a repository of not very well documented and
irreproducible results, but if you have questions about any, just ask.
At first, the exercise on Kaggle is to get to a decent rank on the
leaderboard. Later you realize you need to establish a well defined
and organized workflow so you can keep track of your progress,
reproduce and share your results.  This repo is towards that goal.

The place to start is the README in each of the directories, which
should provide some background on how the competition went and point
to the right ipynb file.
