      "# Predict a purchased policy based on transaction history #\n",
      "\n",
      "As a customer shops an insurance policy, he/she will receive a number of quotes with different coverage options before purchasing a plan. This is represented in this challenge as a series of rows that include a customer ID, information about the customer, information about the quoted policy, and the cost. Your task is to predict the purchased coverage options using a limited subset of the total interaction history. If the eventual purchase can be predicted sooner in the shopping window, the quoting process is shortened and the issuer is less likely to lose the customer's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a customer\u2019s shopping history, can you predict what policy they will end up choosing?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation ###\n",
      "\n",
      "Submissions are evaluated on an all-or-none accuracy basis. You must predict every coverage option correctly to receive credit for a given customer. Your score is the percent of customers for whom you predict the exact purchased policy.\n",

      "\n",
      "The submission format is created by concatenating each plan option (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) as a single string, in order. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",

      "The training and test sets contain transaction history for customers that ended up purchasing a policy. For each customer_ID, you are given their quote history. In the training set you have the entire quote history, the last row of which contains the coverage options they purchased. In the test set, you have only a partial history of the quotes and do not have the purchased coverage options. These are truncated to certain lengths to simulate making predictions with less history (higher uncertainty) or more history (lower uncertainty).\n",
