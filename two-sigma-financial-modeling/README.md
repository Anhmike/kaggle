# Two Sigma Financial Modeling Challenge

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling

<a href='https://www.twosigma.com/'>Two Sigma</a> hosted a challenge to predict what appear to be daily stock market prices. As they describe it:

> This dataset contains anonymized features pertaining to a time-varying
> value for a financial instrument. Each instrument has an id. Time is
> represented by the 'timestamp' feature and the variable to predict is
> 'y'. No further information will be provided on the meaning of the
> features, the transformations that were applied to them, the
> timescale, or the type of instruments that are included in the data.

It was an interesting competition, primarily because if I were to
tackle ML on market data, I would would want to structure the data
exactly as they provided in the training set.  The addition of <a

produce an environment with no leaks or lookahead bias.
